Scripts in this folder include:

- 009\_gather\_sim\_results: This is a script that organizes the results of simulations into a single file.
- 010\_gather\_mut\_matrices: A script that organizes the matrices with the distribution of mutational effects for each
structure in a single file.
- 011\_equation\_system\_solution\_space: This script takes the model used in the simulations and tests the effects of
changes to different parameters on the concentration of heterodimers and homodimers.
- 012\_interface\_summary: It looks at the stickiness and sizes of interfaces.
- 013\_summarize\_dssp: It organizes all the DSSP results in a table format.
- 014\_symmetry\_check: It measures distances at the interface between each residue and its counterpart in the other
subunit to look for self-contacting residues.
