This folder will contain the data from the PDB and some intermediate files generated when looking for suitable homodimers for the simulations.

The folder PDB/unzipped should contain unzipped PDB files to work with. In our work, we used the full set of PDB structures released up to March 29th, 2023.

The folder PDB should contain a pdb_seqres.txt file to work with the sequences of all the PDB files in the unzipped folder.
